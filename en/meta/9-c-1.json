Coverage should refer to LTE, broadband (3G) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular\n  technologies and include: - 2G mobile population coverage: Mobile networks with access to data communications (e.g. Internet) at\n  downstream speeds below 256 Kbit/s. This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS,\n  CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of\n  subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active users of\n  such services.\n  - 3G population coverage: refers to the percentage of inhabitants that are within range of at least a 3G\n  mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing\n  the number of inhabitants that are covered by at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal by the total population\n  and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by GPRS, EDGE or CDMA 1xRTT.\n  - LTE population coverage: Refers to the percentage of inhabitants that live within range of LTE/LTE-\n  Advanced, mobile WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more advanced mobile-cellular networks, irrespective\n  of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants that are\n  covered by the previously mentioned mobile-cellular technologies by the total population and multiplying\n  by 100. It excludes people covered only by HSPA, UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G technologies, and also\n  excludes fixed WiMAX coverage.\n  As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and commercialize more advanced\n  mobile-broadband networks (5G etc.), the indicator will include further breakdo","UNIT_MEASURE":"Proportion of population covered.","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"American Community Survey, 5-Year Data (2019) ","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","ADJUSTMENT":"","IMPUTATION":"","REG_AGG":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-05-26","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-05-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/SDGPI2020/data/commit/1efb1e35c6adba9f3135c36bf68c8e95b74d2ae1","indicator":"9.c.1","target_id":"9.c","sdg_goal":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-0c-01"}
