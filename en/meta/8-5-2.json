PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States\u201450  states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area  (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale  for local areasat 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded  by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes  estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status,  and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to  help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model  cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for  program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include  Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, Census Bureau 2010 population  data, and American Community Survey (ACS).","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2019)","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","ADJUSTMENT":"","IMPUTATION":"","REG_AGG":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-05-26","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-05-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/SDGPI2020/data/commit/13afdfa9b76323a7d14a3efbab75abb5af35e644","indicator":"8.5.2","target_id":"8.5","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-02"}
