Urban poverty rate is \n  the percentage of the urban population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a \n  separate, urban poverty line is used, the urban poverty line). \n\n## Concepts:\n\n  In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty according to national definitions, \n  one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. Poverty lines \n  across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such \n  that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country, the cost \n  of living is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Some countries may have separate urban and\n  rural poverty lines to represent different purchasing powers.
