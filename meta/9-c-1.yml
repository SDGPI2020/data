  ## Concepts:
  
    "The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where they work or go to school, etc.
    When there are multiple operators offering the service, the maximum population number covered should
    be reported. Coverage should refer to LTE, broadband (3G) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular
    technologies and include: - 2G mobile population coverage: Mobile networks with access to data communications (e.g. Internet) at
    downstream speeds below 256 Kbit/s. This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS,
    CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of
    subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active users of
    such services.
    - 3G population coverage: refers to the percentage of inhabitants that are within range of at least a 3G
    mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing
    the number of inhabitants that are covered by at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal by the total population
    and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by GPRS, EDGE or CDMA 1xRTT.
    - LTE population coverage: Refers to the percentage of inhabitants that live within range of LTE/LTE-
    Advanced, mobile WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more advanced mobile-cellular networks, irrespective
    of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants that are
    covered by the previously mentioned mobile-cellular technologies by the total population and multiplying
    by 100. It excludes people covered only by HSPA, UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G technologies, and also
    excludes fixed WiMAX coverage.
    As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and commercialize more advanced
    mobile-broadband networks (5G etc.), the indicator will include further breakdo
