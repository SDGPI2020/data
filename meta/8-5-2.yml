  ## Definition:

    The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed.. 
  
  ## Concepts:
  
    Unemployed persons are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who were not
    in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were
    currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) “not in employment”
    is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment; (b) to
    “seek employment” refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising
    the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or
    agricultural undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish
    between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the
    enterprise’s registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary
    infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context;
    (d) “currently available” serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect
    to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national
    circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not
    exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among
    different population groups).
    Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who, during a
    short reference period such as one week or one day, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or
    provide services for pay or profit.
    The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment.
    For more information on the definitions of employment and unemployment refer to the Resolution
    concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization Adopted by the 19th International
    Conference of Labour Statisticians.

    This dataset contains model-based census tract-level estimates for the PLACES 2021 release. 
    PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 
    states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area 
    (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale 
    for local areasat 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and 
    Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded 
    by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes 
    estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, 
    and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to 
    help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model 
    cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for 
    program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include 
    Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, Census Bureau 2010 population 
    data, and American Community Survey (ACS).
