  ## Definition:
    Due to inaccessibility of mortality rate at the Census Tract level, prevalence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases were used.Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease.Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetesor chronic respiratory diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming thats/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other causeof death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS). This indicator is calculated using life table methods (see furtherdetails in section 3.3).

  ## Concepts:

    Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is rapidly increasing globally due to ageing and epidemiological transitions. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronicrespiratory diseases are the four main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these fourmajor causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality due NCDs in a population.

  This dataset contains model-based census tract-level estimates for the PLACES 2021 release. PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areasat 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS)
